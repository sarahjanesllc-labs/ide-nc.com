<h2>CAD Design Services</h2>

<p>
  IDE offers 3D CAD design services as an integral part of the
  engineering design process. All designs are created using
  either Pro/Engineer or SolidWorks, two of the most widespread CAD
  packages in use today. We strive to build robust CAD
  models which can be easily changed as the design evolves.
</p>
<p>
  We are able to share CAD models and drawings with clients using
  eDrawings. The client simply downloads a free viewer and
  they are able to view 2D drawings and 3D CAD models without having
  to invest in any expensive software. The ability to view
  as well as markup the design files provides a clear collaboration
  tool to ensure the design meets the client&rsquo;s expectations
  before any parts are made.

Once the CAD model is created a virtual prototype can be analyzed
using FEA software in the native CAD format. The advantage
of virtual prototyping is the ability to determine how the part will
respond to anticipated load conditions without having to physically
build a prototype. This reduces development time and costs while
improving the reliability of the design.
